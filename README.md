# ASU for Flipper

My ASU project, but just a lil minified for the Flipper Zero :3

> [!NOTE]
> Development temporarily paused while I figure out the situation with Flipper Zero BLE central, but that will require contributing major code change back to the firmware which will take some time, which I currently don't really have, so yeah, see you in 5 years when I find that time!
